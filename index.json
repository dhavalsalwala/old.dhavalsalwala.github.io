I am working in the Smart Cities and Sustainable IT group where I am researching in the field of realtime analytics and pattern detection for Multimedia Data Streams. Before this, I worked as a Software Professional for over 5 years in the Finance Sector at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). I have comprehensive experience in designing, developing and deploying E2E architecture for complex business process and data processing pipeline. My comprehensive IT experience has given me a strong exposure to the functional and data architectures of critical operations. I was a chief developer to applications like Cash Payment System for Eurex Trading Platform T7 and Risk Management System for Citigroup.

Three multi-agent versions of the RL algorithms have been explored in this research viz. Deep Q networks (DQN), Reinforce and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C). The evaluation results reveal that Reinforce has a better convergence rate in capturing the spatial correlation of the domain using deep learning. A2C is a slow learner and could do better with parameter refinements. In the experiments performed in this thesis, DQN did not perform well owing to the non- stationarity of the domain.
